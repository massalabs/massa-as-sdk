/**
 * This module provides functions for interacting with the execution context of a smart contract on the Massa
 * blockchain.
 *
 * The functions in this module allow you to retrieve information about the current execution context, such as the
 * caller and callee of the current smart contract, the call stack, the amount of transferred coins, the remaining gas,
 * and the timestamp.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The execution context is important for understanding the current state of the smart contract, such as who called
 * the contract, the current contract address, and the transaction creator.
 *
 * Functions such as {@link ownedAddresses}, {@link addressStack}, {@link caller}, {@link callee},
 * {@link transactionCreator}, {@link transferredCoins}, {@link timestamp}, {@link remainingGas},
 * {@link currentThread} and {@link currentPeriod} provide access to important context information
 * during smart contract execution.
 *
 * It is not possible in AssemblyScript to catch thrown exceptions.
 * All exceptions thrown by functions in this module will stop the execution of the smart contract.
 *
 * You can see that your smart contract execution is stopped by looking at the events.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * The `json2Address` function is used to parse a JSON-encoded string of addresses and return an array of `Address`
 * objects. This function is used internally by other functions in this module to convert string representations of
 * addresses into a more usable format.

/**
 * Returns the current call stack of smart contract execution.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The first element of this list is the originator (creator of the transaction)
 * and the last is the address of the current smart-contract.
 *
 * When executing the ExecuteSC function, the list is composed of only one entry:
 * the initiator, the caller and the callee having with the same address.
 *
 * Here is a list of the different cases in the Massa stack system:
 *
 * **ExecuteSC**: when an account A sends an ExecuteSC operation, the stack at the
 * beginning of that execution is: bottom [ A ] top.
 *
 * **CallSC**: when an account A sends a CallSC operation to call a function in a smart
 * contract B, the stack at the beginning of the execution of that function is:
 * bottom [ A, B ] top. Note: A and B can be the same.
 *
 * **Call**: from one smart contract to another: when a function F from smart contract C
 * is being executed with the stack [A, B, C] and calls a function on a smart
 * contract D, the stack at the beginning of the execution of D’s function becomes:
 * bottom [A, B, C, D] top. When D’s function finishes, the stack becomes bottom [A, B, C]
 * top and the execution of F resumes.
 *
 * **Autonomous SC**: a message sent at a moment when the stack was [A, B, C] and calling a target
 * function F of a smart contract D, will yield the following stack at the beginning
 * of the execution of the target function: bottom [C, D] top. Note: C and D can be the same.
 *
 * **Local execution**: local executions don’t change the stack, they allow executing foreign code
 * in the current context.
 *
