/**
 * Ask to schedule the execution of a function at a given address in the future.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The goal of sendMessage functionality is to send a message in the future, that will be executed as soon as possible
 * after the start period but not after the end period.
 *
 * You might want to use the sendMessage functionality:
 * - Having a smart contract called periodically, without a centralized bot;
 * - Having a smart contract that will trigger on the change of value (for example a change in price), of an other one;
 * - Having an object that evolves on the blockchain itself.
 *
 * This message allows you to make executions in the future and
 * they are executed deterministically on all nodes. The execution is made "as soon as possible" because there is a
 * priority on messages and a limit of messages possibly executed on each slot. More precisely, if you send a low amount
 * of `rawFee` then your message could possibly not executed directly at the first slot of the slot period.
 * If all of the slots of the specified period have a large load of messages, with more fees than you specified, then
 * it's highly likely that your message will never be executed.
 *
 * Additionally, there is an optional filter on a message that adds a new condition on the trigger instead of:
 * "as soon as possible in this range", it becomes
 * "as soon as possible, after this field has been updated, in the state, in this range".
 *
 * As a parameter, you can pass the `filterAddress`, and also an optional datastore `filterKey`.
 *
 * If you pass only an address, then the message will be executed only after:
 * "we are in the range, and a change has happened during this range on the `filterAddress`" (possibly balance etc).
 * If you provide a `filterKey`, the condition of the execution of the message is:
 * "we are in the range, and a change has happened during this range on the `filterAddress` at that datastore
 * `filterKey`"
 *
 * Note: serialization is to be handled at the caller and the callee level.
 *
 * @param at - Address of the contract
 * @param functionName - name of the function in that contract
 * @param validityStartPeriod - Period of the validity start slot
 * @param validityStartThread - Thread of the validity start slot
 * @param validityEndPeriod - Period of the validity end slot
 * @param validityEndThread - Thread of the validity end slot
 * @param maxGas - Maximum gas for the message execution
 * @param rawFee - Fee to be paid for message execution
 * @param coins - Coins of the sender
 * @param msg - function argument serialized in bytes
 * @param filterAddress - If you want your message to be trigger only
 * if a modification is made on a specific address precise it here
 * @param filterKey - If you want your message to be trigger only
 * if a modification is made on a specific storage key of the `filterAddress` precise it here
